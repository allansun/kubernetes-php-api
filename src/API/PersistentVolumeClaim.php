     * restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when
     * watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
     * returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * 'fieldSelector'	string
     * A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to
     * everything.
     * 'includeUninitialized'	boolean
     * If true, partially initialized resources are included in the response.
     * 'labelSelector'	string
     * A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to

     * 'limit'	integer
     * limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items

     * that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of

     * to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients

     * will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue
     * field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This
     * field is not supported if watch is true.
     *
     * The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be

     * created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included
     * in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a
     * consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive
     * smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.
     * If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was
     * present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * 'resourceVersion'	string
     * When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular
     * version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When
     * specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage
     * based on quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we currently
     * have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least
     * as fresh as given rv.
     * 'timeoutSeconds'	integer
     * Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call,
     * regardless of any activity or inactivity.
     * 'watch'	boolean
     * Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add,
     * update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.
